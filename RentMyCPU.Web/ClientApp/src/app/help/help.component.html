      What is RentMyCPU ?
    </p>
    <p>
      RentMyCPU is a decentralized marketplace for computing power. It enables CPUs to connect in a network, enabling
      individual users ("requestors") to rent resources from other usersâ€™ ("providers") machines.

    <p>
      You can win credits by executing tasks from other requestors. To win credits you have to leave the app open and
      maximized, and
      you will be selected randomly when a new task will be available on the network to execute it.

      You can ask for new tasks to be executed on the network by clicking the "Create task" button from the menu.
